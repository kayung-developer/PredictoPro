*   Twelve Data API (for stock/forex data - *requires API key*)
*   (Placeholders for other data sources like news APIs, on-chain data providers)

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   A modern web browser.
*   Python 3.8+ (for running the backend).
*   `pip` (Python package installer).
*   Node.js and `npm` (for the build step if used).
*   A Firebase project set up with Email/Password authentication enabled.
*   API keys for CoinMarketCap and Twelve Data (optional, but needed for real data).

### Local Development Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
    cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup (`main.py`):**
    *   Create a virtual environment (recommended):
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    *   Install Python dependencies:
        ```bash
        pip install fastapi uvicorn python-dotenv httpx "passlib[bcrypt]" pyjwt firebase-admin
        ```
    *   Create a `.env` file in the root directory (where `main.py` is) and add your API keys and secrets:
        ```env
        SECRET_KEY="your_very_strong_random_secret_key_here"
        TWELVEDATA_API_KEY="your_twelvedata_api_key"
        COINMARKETCAP_API_KEY="your_coinmarketcap_api_key"
        FIREBASE_ADMIN_SDK_JSON_PATH="path/to/your/firebase-adminsdk-credentials.json" 
        # Download this JSON from Firebase Console -> Project Settings -> Service Accounts
        ```
        **Important:** Add `.env` and your Firebase Admin SDK JSON file to your `.gitignore`.
    *   Run the FastAPI backend:
        ```bash
        python main.py
        ```
        The backend should start on `http://localhost:8000`.

3.  **Frontend Setup (`index.html`):**
    *   Open `index.html` in your web browser directly (file://... path).
    *   **OR (for better development experience with live reload & Parcel build):**
        *   Install Parcel:
            ```bash
            npm install -g parcel-bundler # or yarn global add parcel-bundler
            ```
        *   Navigate to the directory containing `index.html`.
        *   Run Parcel's development server:
            ```bash
            parcel index.html
            ```
            This will typically serve the frontend on `http://localhost:1234` and handle live reloading.
    *   **Update Firebase Configuration:** Open `index.html` and replace the placeholder `firebaseConfig` object with your actual Firebase project configuration values.

### Building for Production (with Parcel)

If you choose to use the Parcel build step for GitHub Pages:

1.  **Install dev dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install --save-dev parcel-bundler @babel/core @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react
    # If not already global, or use npx parcel build index.html
    ```
2.  **Add build script to `package.json` (create this file if it doesn't exist):**
    ```json
    // package.json
    {
      "name": "predicto-pro",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "description": "Real-time Stock/Crypto Prediction App",
      "source": "index.html", // Entry point for Parcel
      "scripts": {
        "dev": "parcel index.html",
        "build": "parcel build index.html --dist-dir docs --public-url ./",
        "predeploy": "npm run build",
        "deploy": "gh-pages -d docs" 
      },
      "devDependencies": {
        "@babel/core": "^7.0.0", // Babel will be handled by Parcel
        "parcel-bundler": "^1.12.5",
        "gh-pages": "^3.0.0" // For deploying to gh-pages branch (alternative to Actions)
      },
      "browserslist": "> 0.5%, last 2 versions, not dead" // For Parcel's Babel transpilation
    }
    ```
    *   The `build` script tells Parcel to build `index.html` and output the optimized files into a `docs` directory. The `--public-url ./` is important for GitHub Pages to correctly resolve asset paths.
    *   The `docs` directory is commonly used for GitHub Pages source.

3.  **Run the build:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This will create a `docs` folder with your compiled application.

## üöÄ Deployment to GitHub Pages

### Method 1: Using the `docs` folder (after `npm run build`)

1.  Ensure your `package.json` build script outputs to a `docs` folder at the root of your repository.
2.  Push the `docs` folder (along with your other source code) to your GitHub repository.
3.  Go to your GitHub repository settings.
4.  Under "Pages" (in the "Code and automation" section):
    *   Set the "Source" to "Deploy from a branch".
    *   Set the "Branch" to `main` (or `master`) and the folder to `/docs`.
    *   Click "Save".
5.  Your site should be available at `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME/`.

### Method 2: Using GitHub Actions (Recommended for CI/CD)

Create a workflow file: `.github/workflows/deploy-gh-pages.yml`

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main # Or your default branch

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout üõéÔ∏è
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18' # Or your preferred Node.js version

      - name: Install dependencies üîß
        run: npm install 
        # If you have a package-lock.json or yarn.lock, use 'npm ci' or 'yarn install --frozen-lockfile'

      - name: Build application üì¶
        run: npm run build # This should create the 'docs' directory

      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages üöÄ
        uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@v4
        with:
          branch: gh-pages # The branch the action should deploy to.
          folder: docs     # The folder the action should deploy.
          # Optional: Add clean: true to remove old files from the gh-pages branch before deploying
          # clean: true 
```
*   This workflow checks out your code, sets up Node.js, installs dependencies, runs your build script, and then deploys the contents of the `docs` folder to a `gh-pages` branch.
*   You would then configure GitHub Pages in your repository settings to serve from the `gh-pages` branch.

### Method 3: Deploying Single `index.html` (No Build Step)

If you want to deploy your current `index.html` directly without a build step:

1.  Make sure your `index.html` file is at the root of your repository or in a `docs` folder.
2.  Go to your GitHub repository settings.
3.  Under "Pages":
    *   Set "Source" to "Deploy from a branch".
    *   Set "Branch" to `main` (or `master`).
    *   Set folder to `/` (root) or `/docs` depending on where your `index.html` is.
4.  Your site will be served. Performance will be impacted by in-browser Babel compilation. Relative paths for assets (CSS, JS within the HTML) should work.

**2. `package.json` (If using the build step with Parcel)**

```json
{
  "name": "predicto-pro",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Ultimate Real-time Stock/Crypto Prediction App",
  "source": "index.html",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "parcel index.html --open",
    "build": "parcel build index.html --dist-dir docs --public-url ./",
    "predeploy": "npm run build",
    "deploy": "gh-pages -d docs"
  },
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "git+https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git"
  },
  "keywords": [
    "react",
    "fastapi",
    "stock",
    "crypto",
    "prediction",
    "tradingview"
  ],
  "author": "Your Name <your.email@example.com>",
  "license": "MIT",
  "bugs": {
    "url": "https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME/issues"
  },
  "homepage": "https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME",
  "devDependencies": {
    "@babel/core": "^7.23.0", 
    "parcel-bundler": "^1.12.5",
    "gh-pages": "^6.0.0" 
  },
  "browserslist": "> 0.5%, last 2 versions, not dead"
}
```
*   Run `npm install` after creating/updating this file to get the dev dependencies.

**3. `.gitignore`**

Create a `.gitignore` file in the root of your project:

```
# Node modules
node_modules/

# Parcel cache
.cache/

# Build output directory (if not deploying from this specific folder, like when using gh-pages branch)
# If you use the "docs" folder method AND commit it, don't ignore docs.
# If you use gh-pages branch or GitHub Actions to build and deploy, you can ignore docs from main branch.
# For simplicity with the build script outputting to 'docs', we might commit 'docs' initially
# or use the gh-pages script which handles it. Let's assume we might commit it for direct gh-pages folder serving.
# docs/ 

# Environment variables file
.env

# Firebase Admin SDK credentials
firebase-adminsdk-credentials.json 
*.json # If your SDK key has a different generic name, be more specific

# IDE / OS specific
.DS_Store
.idea/
*.suo
*.user
*.log
Thumbs.db
```

**4. GitHub Actions Workflow (Optional - `.github/workflows/deploy-gh-pages.yml`)**

(The YAML content is already provided in the README section for "Method 2: Using GitHub Actions"). Create the directories `.github/workflows/` in your project root and place the `deploy-gh-pages.yml` file there.

---

**If you are NOT using the build step (deploying `index.html` directly):**

*   You primarily need the `README.md` and `.gitignore`.
*   You won't need `package.json` for build scripts or the GitHub Actions workflow for building.
*   Deployment is simply pushing `index.html` (and your `main.py` for others to run locally) and configuring GitHub Pages to serve from the `main` branch and the `/` (root) or `/docs` folder (if you place `index.html` there).

**Final Steps:**

1.  **Choose your deployment method** (with or without build step).
2.  Create/update the files as described.
3.  **Replace placeholders** like `YOUR_USERNAME`, `YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME`, `path/to/your/firebase-adminsdk-credentials.json`, and API keys.
4.  Commit these files to your Git repository:
    ```bash
    git add README.md package.json .gitignore index.html main.py # Add other relevant files
    # If using GitHub Actions:
    git add .github/workflows/deploy-gh-pages.yml
    git commit -m "Add project documentation and setup for GitHub Pages deployment"
    git push origin main
    ```
5.  Configure GitHub Pages in your repository settings according to the method you chose.

This provides a solid foundation for your project's documentation and deployment. Remember to fill in the API keys and Firebase config in `index.html` and `.env` before deploying or running locally.
